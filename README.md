# Streamline
<code>**Streamline**</code> is an application for making our daily activities organized. It will have features that will help us with planning our day, tracking our progress towards our goals and habits, etc. The main focus of this application will be to encourage users' engagement with the application through a gamified concept. The main problem that arises when a user plans or tracks their daily life activities in a task manager is that they lose interest in it after using it for a few days. However, this problem can be solved by fully implementing gamification, where after finishing the tasks, they can get rewards..
